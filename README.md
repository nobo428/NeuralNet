XOR NeuralNet Generator
=======================
 
The XOR NeuralNet Generator creates backpropogating artificial neural networks to solve the XOR truth table!
It creates 100 networks and attempts to train them, based on the network size and training information provided by the user.
 
To use the program for the first time, navigate to the home directory and run:
	make clean
	make compile

From then on, use the following command to start the program:
	make start
 
Features
--------

- Creates up to 100 backpropogating neural networks
- Can create networks of any size
- Adjustable learning rate
- Trains each network for a user-set number of iterations
- Searches for network that operates below a desired error threshold after training
 
Installation
------------
 
Install XOR NeuralNet Generator by running:
 
    git clone https://github.com/nobo428/XOR-NeuralNet-Generator.git

while in desired directory.
